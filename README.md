# 📘 Cloud Cost Intelligence Platform
**Data Engineer Intern – Take-Home Assignment**

**Prepared by:** Rohit Manvar

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete multi-cloud cost intelligence platform designed for FinOps use cases. It includes data modeling, transformation logic, data quality validation, exploratory analysis, and an end-to-end pipeline architecture for AWS + GCP cloud billing.

The solution follows FinOps principles for:
- Cost visibility & allocation
- Multi-cloud normalization
- Anomaly detection & insights
- Team-wise & environment-wise reporting
- Scalable data processing

## 📊 Key Features

### ✅ Unified Multi-Cloud Billing Schema
- Standardized structure for AWS CUR & GCP Billing Export
- Normalized field names, data types, and spending metrics
- Extensible service dictionary

### ✅ Star-Schema Data Warehouse
**Includes:**
- `fact_billing` (daily cost per cloud, service, team, project/account)
- **Dimension tables:**
  - Time
  - Cloud provider
  - Service
  - Team
  - Environment
  - AWS account
  - GCP project

Optimized for FinOps cost reporting.

### ✅ Data Quality Validation
**Covers:**
- Duplicate checks
- Invalid/missing dates
- Missing dimensional attributes
- Service mismatches
- Negative cost validations
- Project/account mapping consistency

### ✅ SQL Transformations
**Includes SQL for:**
- Unified multi-cloud spend view
- Monthly spend by cloud provider
- Spend by team & environment
- Top 5 most expensive services
- Cost anomaly identification

### ✅ Pipeline Architecture (Medallion Model)
**Bronze → Silver → Gold multilayered design:**
- **Bronze** → Raw billing from S3/GCS
- **Silver** → Cleaned & normalized billing
- **Gold** → Final analytics marts

**Technologies used:**

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Ingestion | Airflow DAGs |
| Storage | S3 / GCS |
| Data Warehouse | Snowflake |
| Transformation | dbt |
| Quality | Great Expectations |
| Visualization | Tableau |

## 🧱 Data Model (Star Schema)

`fact_billing` is stored at daily granularity combining:
- `cloud_provider` + `project/account` + `service` + `team` + `environment` + `date`

**Dimensions include:**
- `dim_time`
- `dim_cloud_provider`
- `dim_service`
- `dim_team`
- `dim_environment`
- `dim_aws_account`
- `dim_gcp_project`

**Supports:**
- Multi-cloud normalization
- Showback/chargeback allocation
- Credits as negative cost
- Service categorization

## 🛠 SQL Transformations Available

The repository includes queries for:

### 1. Unified Spend Table
Standardized AWS + GCP spend with:
- `cloud_provider`
- `service`
- `project/account`
- `environment`
- `team`
- `cost_usd`
- `date`

### 2. Monthly Spend by Cloud
Aggregated spend by:
- Month
- AWS vs GCP

### 3. Spend by Team & Environment
Drilling into:
- Team-wise cost
- Environment: prod, dev, staging

### 4. Top Services
Top 5 high-cost services across clouds.

## 📈 Insights Example

### 🔍 Unexpected AWS EC2 Spend Spike (34%)
No corresponding workload growth

**Possible anomalies:**
- Orphaned EC2 instances
- Auto-scaling misconfiguration

**Recommended Actions:**
- Verify instance uptime
- Review Auto Scaling group logs
- Set cost guardrails & alerts
